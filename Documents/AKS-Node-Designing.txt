Min: 3 Worker Node, 2 Master Node
	
	How Many Worker Node
		Depends Upon; Configuration of Worker Node and Overall computation power required.
				Find Overall computtional Power.
				
				

Example 1: Client: 1 Application: Min pods=4, Max Pods=12, Database as well.

			1 Pods: 1 Core CPU, 4GB RAM   ---- as per market standards
				Overall Computational Power: 
								Min: 1 Core* 4 Pods= 4 Core
									 4 GB8* 4 Pods= 16 GB
									Buffer (10-15%): 4.6 Core, 18.4 GB Memory
																		 
									 
								Max: 1 Core* 12 Pods= 12 Core
									 4 GB* 12 Pods= 48 GB
									 Buffer (10-15%): 13.8 Core, 55.2 GB


				Min: 4.6 Core, 18.4 GB Memory; 5 Core, 20 GB		Server( 1 Core, 4 GB): Min, 5 Worker Node
				Max: 13.8 Core, 55.2 GB; 14 Core, 56 GB				Server( 1 Core, 4 GB): Max, 14 Worker Node			5-14 Node AKS cluster
				
																	Server (4 Core, 16 GB): Min, 1 Worker Node
																	Server( 4 Core, 16 GB): Max, 4 Worker Node			1-4 Node AKS Cluster
		

Note: In case of DB, select VM with high IOPS


Note: High Availibility---> Availibility Zones, Min 3 Zones, Depends upon region, Region

Example 2: 1 Application Min Pods=4, Scale upto 8 pods.
MIN: 1 cpu 4 gb ram  monolithic
4*1 core 4*4gb ram= 4core 16 gb ram add 20 % buffer 3.2 16+3.2= 20 gb memory

max:1 cpu 4 gb ram
1*8 core 8*4gb =8 cpu 32 gb memory

20% buffer: 6.4=32+6.4= MA   40 GB memory 



Exapmple 3: 2 Applications
			Application 1: Min Pod =2, Max Pods=6
			Application 2: Min pods =3, Max Pod=5


Example 4: 1 Appliation 4-16 pods, memory=512 GB

---------------------------------

In XYZ project, I have worked as DevOps engineer primarily focussed on Azure DevOps and Kubernetes, where I was responsible for performing multi stage deployment of different application such as Java, Python, .Net.
In this role, I have deployed application using both the method, viz Using Azure DevOps Pipeline and traditional Kubernetes CLI. Also, I was responsible to ensure that the application is running smooth, and if we encounter any error such as "Crashloopbackoff Error" or others, we have to resolve the errors.

About the multi stage deployment I told earlier, so we were creating namespaces such as UAT, Dev, PreProd, Prod in the same kubernetes and were deploying there.

What are the different errors you faced.
	We primarily faced "Crashloop Backoff" error, which occurs for multiple reason such as wrong image URL, Wrong tag in deployment file, or expiration of access key of ACR etc.
	
How you resolved the errors ?
	If we are getting error in pipeline, then we have to go to Kubernetes server and perform manual deployment using the same deployment file, post which we have to analyze logs of pods, deployment, services to check where exactly where is the issue, post which based on logs we have to find and apply the solution.
	
	kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
	
	kubectl get all
	
	kubectl describe pod PodName
	
	kubectl descibe deployment DeployMentName
	
	kubectl describe service ServiceName
	
What are the steps of CI/CD pipeline ?
Build Pipeline
	Build
	SCA (Static Code Analysis)--- SonarQube
		Prepare code analysis
		Run code analysis
		push code analysis result
	Docker build and push
	Copy and publish to artifacts
	
Release
