Hive is a data warehouse which provides us sql like query (Hive QL) on structured hadoop data.
Hive is used to data summarization, data query, and data analysis.
This language translates SQL-like queries into MapReduce jobs for deploying them on Hadoop.
Hive is best suited for batch jobs, rather than working with web log data and append-only data. It cannot work for online transaction processing (OLTP) systems since it does not provide real-time querying for row-level updates. 
Hive is generally used for creating reports.
Data warehouse refers to a system used for reporting and data analysis. What this means is inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information and suggesting conclusions
Hive as data warehouse designed for managing and querying only structured data that is stored in tables

i.e hive will convert your query in M-R jobs internally, and then these jobs will go to master node for processing.
For single user metadata storage, Hive uses derby database and for multiple user Metadata or shared Metadata case Hive uses MYSQL.
